**Title:** [4]Changing Privacy Policy and Regulations

**Preconditions:** User is logged in

**Question?** I'm not sure is that because you as a company can't have user data without his agreement on terms and privacy policy, but when I click checkbox referring to them, there is a modal for deleting account, not for changing anything, and I don't see any information about that.

**Test steps:**
1. Scroll down to a Privacy Policy section 
2. click on the checkbox referring to that section
3. check all checkboxes
4. Click "Usu≈Ñ konto"

**Expected result:** Users account is deleted, he cannot longer log in using his credentials, app does not contain any of his information (I suppose :))
